# Angle Recruiter

## üí° Inspiration
For people in their 3rd or 4th year of college with the internship or placement season around the corner. Students are already worried about how are they going to brush up their skills, is their resumes good enough, and how to contact top qualified people from which they can ask about their dream company and the skillset required to ace that company.  To solve and lessen the burden of college students we came up with the ** ANGEL RECRUITER**.
